NPUs are computer processors specifically designed to handle
 network-related functions. These little processors are typically
 found on embedded systems, but recently there have been moves
 to bring them into the realm of personal computers (PCs). One
 notable is the network card (called NIC), and NPU network cards
 have become common nowadays.

\section{What's NPU}
Network Processing Unit, a.k.a. Network Processor (NP) is an
 integrated circuit (IC) which has a feature set specifically
 targeted at the networking application demain.

Network processors are typically software programmable devices
 and would have generic characteristics similar to general purpose
 central processing units (CPU) that are commonly used in many
 different types of equipment and products.
